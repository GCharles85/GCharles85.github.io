## About My Project

I am helping to create a speech recognition system to help people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/RDs) as well as their caretakers find medical and other services in their area. This chatbot is meant to be a speech recognition system. One major hurdle is that popular speech recognition systems such as Alexa are trained to recognize and respond to certain accents and dialects that the older Black population of Alabama tend to not have. More specifically, the older Black population in the communities of Birmingham, Mobile, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa. Due to this shortcoming, there is a focus on making our speech recognition system more inclusive of African American speech. This speech recognition system is meant to be connected to a GIS backend to further develop a community asset mapping technology.
