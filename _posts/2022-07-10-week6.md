title: Week 6

This week, I have started adding scripts from the voxforge example directory to my run.sh script in CORAAL. 
These scripts mainly have the job of creating the components of a model then training it. In the process, 
several files are created for the model to refer to such as files containing phones or sounds. 
There have been no major issues with the code this week.
