title: Week 2

For this week, I have started writing a bash script in the egs directory of the Kaldi toolkit to automate the creation of the test and train folders. These folders will contain the audio files to train and test the ASR we are designing. I am choosing to place the script in this directory as it conveniently contains other scripts that will be useful in this process such as scripts to download more datasets and those to use the models. In the process of pulling the kaldi image, I am going to be working with for the summer, a toy dataset that we had not expected to be in the final image was included in the final image. Dr. Anderson and I spent some time attempting to figure out how this dataset, the yesno dataset, ended up there. This was a very useful experience as I learned about the github hierarchy behind the image pulls. I also learned some more useful bash techniques such as listing out files of a certain format.
