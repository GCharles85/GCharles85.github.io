For this week, the only issue I have had is that the code in my run script that creates a text file is not working as intended. When creating a text file for the training data, non-conversational descriptors such as pauses are included. As for the training data, the text file only has one line from the transcript of that interview. That line is repeated over and over again for every utterance from that interview. Besides this bug, all the code that I have written is working as intended. After this, I plan on creating a complete model from the data I have right now. After that, I will use data from the HistoryMakers website to create a model as a way to test my code on real world data.
