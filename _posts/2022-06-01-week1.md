For the first week, I got acquainted with the research space as well as the people I would be working with. I also got acquainted with the project itself. The end goal is to create a community asset mapping system that can be accessed via a automated speech recognition system (ASRs). Such systems must be trained to recognize certain types of speech and therefore are prone to bias. My side of the project more explicitly deals with curbing this bias. Mainstream ASRs tested in Pickens County, Alabama by my mentor and her graduate student especially have a hard time recognizing the speech of African Americans living in senior care centers in that area. We are looking to design a more speech inclusive system. The toolkit we are going to be using is called Kaldi. We will be using Docker to create a virtual environment to use Kaldi so I have been studying the Kaldi documentation as well as audio repositories such as CORAAL that can be used to supply Kaldi with sound files.
