This week, nothing much of note occurred. I have begun attempting to modify my CORAAL scripts to work on data from the HistoryMakers website as a proof of concept.
Currently, I am gathering transcript material from the website and preformatting it to work with the style of processing in my getdata and run scripts. It is different 
from CORAAL since those transcripts are already clearly labeled in terms of who's a subject and this makes it easier to extract utterances from the CORAAL data.
