title: Week 10

 For this week, I began collecting data from the HistoryMakers Website. I am creating transcripts in the CORAAL format with timestamps. 
One aspect that I am wondering about is that the utterances in the HistoryMakers interviews are much longer than the CORAAL ones. 
I and Dr. Anderson do not think this will matter but it would definitely be more work to parse the utterances into smaller chunks since I am
having to create the transcripts manually right now. The end goal is to run some of the HistoryMakers data through my scripts 
so I will need to download the audio as well which my scripts take care of as well.
